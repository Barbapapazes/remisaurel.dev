# What's this project about?

memoire is a flashcard project I've been working on for a few weeks now. The goal is to create a tool that helps me memorize things more efficiently using flashcards.\
After some readings about :special-word{iconName='uil:calendar-alt'}[spaced-repetition] in technology-enhanced-learning, I've identified limitations about existing tools: **UX**, **flexibility**, but also **open-source alternatives** or **research-friendly tools**.

This post will mostly talk about the project's inception, the technologies I've used, and the first steps I've taken to build it. I won't go too deep in the technical details, this will be the subject of future posts.

## Technology-Enhanced Learning

:word-tooltip{tooltip="Technology-Enhanced Learning"}[TEL] is a broad term that refers to the use of technology to support learning.\
It's been 2 years that I've worked in the field of TEL: my apprenticeship at [Kosmos](https://www.kosmos-education.com/) and within the [TALENT team](https://www.irit.fr/TALENT/site/en/home/) at [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/). This field particularly interests me because it combines my passion for technology and my interest in education.

### The 4 pillars of learning

Stanislas Dehaene, a French neuroscientist, has identified 4 pillars of learning: **Attention**, **Active Engagement**, **Error Feedback**, and **Consolidation**. In his book :special-word{iconName='uil:book-open'}[Apprendre] (Les talents du cerveau, le d√©fi des machines), he explains how these 4 pillars are essential to learning.
