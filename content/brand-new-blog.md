# Why ?

After several experimentations on a custom-made blog, the inertia of the project has been too much to handle. I've decided to switch to a more robust solution, and _NuxtContent_ seems to be the perfect fit between flexibility and ease of use.

::blockquote{type="info"}
This is the first post of my new blog. I'm still working on the design and the content. I'll try to release new content as soon as possible and share misc, useful or not, thoughts.

# How ?

With the amazing [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) ecosystem, I've been able to set up the blog in a few minutes. I'm using :tag{color="green"}[NuxtContent] to manage the content and :tag{color="gray"}[UnoCSS] for the design.

# What ?

Tutorials, tips, and tricks but also random thoughts about my journey in the tech world and my life in general.
I'll also be able to share code snippets, and maybe some projects I'm working on.
Here's an example of a code snippet:

```js [main.js]
const hello = "world";
console.log(hello);
```

# When ?

I'll try to release new content as soon as possible. I'm still working on the design and the content, so stay tuned! ðŸ˜Ž
